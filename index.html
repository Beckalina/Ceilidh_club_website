	<h2>Welcome to Ceilidh++!</h2>

  <p>Ceilidh++ is a brand new addition to the Cambridge folk scene, a weekly evening of dancing and live music. We dance a mixture of ceilidh, contra, French, and more. Every other week the plan is that part of evening will be a taster workshop for a different style of dance, a bit like an IVFDF workshop - so far we've had contra, clog and French. We have live music each week thanks to our wonderful scratch band, so you can participate as a dancer, musician, or both!</p>

  <h3>When and where?</h3>

  <p>Tuesdays evenings 8-10.15pm in the back hall of the Wesley Methodist church (by Christ's Pieces).</p>

  <h3>Who can come?</h3>

  <p>Anyone! You don't have to be a student, and it doesn't matter if you have never done any folk dancing before, or just the occassional ceilidh, or you're an experienced dancer. We always aim to pick dances that are fun to dance but also accessible to newcomers. And the fortnightly workshops mean that there is always the chance to try something new.</p>
