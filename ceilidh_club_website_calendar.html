  <h2>About the workshops</h2>

  <h3>Contra</h3>

  <p>Contra dance is an American style of social dancing, born in New England but with its origins in English, Scottish, and French country dance styles. Sometimes described as New England folk dance or Appalachian folk dance, contra dances can be found around the world, but are most common in the United States (periodically held in nearly every state), Canada, and other Anglophone countries.</p>

  <p>Contra sets are made up of long lines of couples. Throughout the course of a dance, couples progress up and down these lines, dancing with each other couple in the line. </p>
